<p class="welcome-text"><strong>The Garden Project</strong> is a simple website created by Darlene Sepulveda. The main goal was to showcase 
    <em>beautiful personally designed flower artworks</em> on shirts for sale. 
    While the aspect of viewing through the gallery and shopping for shirts are unavailable at the moment, 
    feel free to just blankly stare at this webpage.
